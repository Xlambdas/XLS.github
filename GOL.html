                    <h2>The original idea</h2>
                    <p>
                    The idea was born from a simple frustration: feeling like life was slipping by without structure, growth, or meaning. I wanted a way to transform my daily routine into a series of quests, each with its own challenges and rewards. The goal was to create a system that would not only help me stay organized but also inspire me to push my limits and achieve more. <br>
                    "Game of Life" was created to turn everyday existence into a personal quest for mastery. Inspired by RPG mechanics and self-development philosophy, this system lets you track progress, complete meaningful quests, and level up in real life, you get a visual view of your lifes — all within the powerful environment of Obsidian. It’s not just about productivity. It’s about growth.

                    <h2>Who is it for?</h2>
                    <p>
                    Imagine waking up each day with a clear set of quests to tackle. You start with a morning routine quest, then move on to a work-related challenge, and finally, you end the day with a personal growth task. Each completed quest earns you experience points, which contribute to your overall level. As you progress, you unlock new abilities and rewards that enhance your daily life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This plugin is for anyone who wants to take control of their life, whether you’re a student, a professional, or simply someone looking to add more structure and fun to your daily routine. It’s for those who believe that life can be more than just a series of tasks — it can be an epic journey of growth and achievement.
